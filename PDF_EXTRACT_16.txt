Traction Control System Using a Fuzzy Representation of the Vehicle
Model
H. Dahmani, O. Pag`es and A. El Hajjaji
Abstract— In this paper, a traction control system has been
designed in order to improve vehicle traction on slippery roads.
First, a nonlinear model has been formulated from the vehicle
longitudinal dynamics, the drivetrain model and the wheel
motion. Then, a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy representation has
been proposed in order to take into account the nonlinearities
of the obtained model and to simplify the controller design.
Based on the obtained TS model, a proportional integral (PI)
state feedback controller has been developed. The objective is
to compute the optimal engine torque so that the longitudinal
slip ratio does not exceed a desired value which is the limit of
the optimal traction and the vehicle stability. Lypunov and H∞
approaches have been used in the controller design and stability
conditions are given in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMI). In order to show the effectiveness of the developed
approaches, the vehicle model has been simulated on a slippery
road with and without the traction control system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Critical driving situations like a slippery or snowy road
can lead to vehicle instability and reduce traction perfor-
mance. This can be the consequence of the acceleration
process which increases the wheel slip. In such situations,
longitudinal forces which drive the vehicle are saturated and,
moreover, the lateral forces decrease and approach to zero.
At this point, the accident risk is great because the vehicle
may spin and the front wheels cannot be correctly steered.
Traction Control Systems (TCS) or Anti Slip Regulation
Systems (ASR) came up since 1990 to improve the traction,
stability and steer-ability of the vehicle. They are widely
integrated into various vehicles nowadays.
The objective of a traction control system is to compute
the optimal engine torque that can be transmitted to the
wheels in order to ensure optimal traction and stability.
Many research works on traction control systems have been
performed during the past decade. Different control methods
have been proposed, some of them are formulated for traction
with a combustion engine using throttle valve control [1]-[3].
These approaches need to consider the behaviour of the com-
bustion engine in the control loop [4]. In other studies, many
authors have proposed traction control methods for electric
vehicles [5]-[7]. Other papers have only considered the
traction torque which is applied to the wheel as the control
input, using several control methods, including Proportional-
Integral-Derivative (PID) control, sliding-mode control and

fuzzy control [8]-[11]. The advantage of the PID controller
is the simplicity and its application without a mathematical
model, but it is difﬁcult to obtain the control parameters
to achieve satisfactory results, especially when the road
conditions change. Sliding mode control has good advantages
to control nonlinear systems, however, problems stemming
from chattering may have negative consequences on the TCS.
The fuzzy control method requires many tests to ﬁnd the
optimal rules. In this work, we propose a new approach
which has the advantage of simplicity despite nonlinearities
of the system. The proposed method can be easily extended
to consider parameter variations in the vehicle model and
the unavailability of vehicle velocity measurement. A robust
control method is proposed to avoid wheel slip on slippery
roads by operating on the transmitted engine torque. Firstly,
a nonlinear state model has been developed from the vehicle
longitudinal dynamics, the wheel motion and the drivetrain
model. Then, the obtained model is represented using a TS
fuzzy model. Based on this representation, a fuzzy PI state
feedback controller is designed and its main objective is to
force the longitudinal slip ratio to track the desired value
which is the limit of the stable region. An H∞tracking perfor-
mance, which is related to the tracking error, is formulated.
The proposed control system design is represented in terms
of LMI which can be efﬁciently solved by using the existing
LMI solvers. Simulation results have been obtained using
two driving tests in order to illustrate the effectiveness of
the developed techniques.
The paper is organized as follows: the description of
the nonlinear vehicle model with the TS approximation is
presented in Section II. The controller design procedure will
be presented in Section III. In Section IV simulation results
are given in order to show the effectiveness of the developed
controller. Finally, some conclusions are given in section V.
II. VEHICLE MODEL ANALYSIS
The model used in this work describes the vehicle longi-
tudinal dynamics and wheel dynamics during acceleration.
The obtained nonlinear model has been approximated by a
TS fuzzy representation in order to design the traction control
system.
A. Vehicle and wheel motion
The equation of the vehicle longitudinal motion during
acceleration in a plane road without considering the driving
resistance and lateral dynamics is given as follows
M ˙vx = Fx fl +Fx fr +Fxrl +Fxrr
(1)

where Fx fl, Fx fr, Fxrl and Fxrr are the longitudinal forces
acting on the four wheels of the vehicle, M is the vehicle
mass and vx is the longitudinal speed.
Fig. 1.
Wheel motion model
The wheel motion is described by the following equation
Jw ˙ωw = Tw −Tb −RFx
(2)
where Jw is wheel inertia moment, ωw is the wheel angular
velocity, Tw is the torque transmitted from the motor to the
wheel axe, Tb is the torque generated by the braking, R is
the wheel radius and Fx is the wheel traction force.
B. Drivetrain model
The drivetrain is the complete powertrain that propels the
car except the engine. The precise components of the drive-
train vary according to the type of vehicle. We here consider
a simple drivetrain including the clutch, the transmission, the
driveshaft and the wheels [12][13].
Fig. 2.
Simple drivetrain model
For simplicity, the transient characteristics and the damp-
ing effects of clutch and transmission are ignored. Applying
Newton’s second law on each component of the drivetrain
the following equations are obtained:
Je ˙ωe = Te −Tc
(3)
Jc ˙ωc = Tc −Tt
(4)
Jt ˙ωt = Tt −Tv
rtrf
(5)
Jv ˙ωv = Tv −2Tb −2RFx
(6)
where, Je, we and Te are the engine inertia, angular speed
and torque, respectively, Jc, wc, and Tc the clutch inertia,
angular speed and torque, respectively, Jt , wt and Tt the
transmission inertia, angular speed and torque, respectively.
rt is the transmission gear ratio, r f the ﬁnal gear ratio, and
Tv the driveshaft torque.
The relation between the driveshaft and the wheel motion
is given by
ωv = ωw,
Jv = 2Jw
It is also assumed that the relation between the different
angular speeds are given as follows
ωe = ωc = ωt = rtrf ωv
The equivalent model from the engine to the wheel is
obtained by substituting (3), (4) and (5) into (6)
Jeq ˙ωw = rtrf
2 Te −Tb −RFx
(7)
where Jeq is the equivalent inertia given as follows
Jeq = (Je +Jc +Jt)(rtrf )2
2
+Jw
(8)
C. State space model
In this work, only the front wheels are assumed to be
drived. It is also assumed that the torque transmitted from
the engine to each wheel is the same:
Fx fl = Fx fr = Fx
(9)
The engine has been considered as a simple actuators repre-
sented by a ﬁrst order transfer function given as follows:
Te =
k
1+τsTd
(10)
where k and τ are the transfer function parameters which
depend on the engine characteristics and Td is the desired
torque given by the driver or the traction controller.
Considering the longitudinal vehicle speed, the angular
wheel speed and the engine torque as system states, the
following state model can be obtained for the traction
situation:



M ˙vx = 2Fx
Jeq ˙ωw = rtrf
2 Te −RFx
˙Te = −1
τ Te + k
τ Td
(11)
The longitudinal force Fx is proportional to the vertical force
Fz and the adhesion coefﬁcient µ which is highly dependent
on the road surface conditions [1]:
Fx = µ(λ)Fz
Consider the effects of longitudinal load transfer during
acceleration, the vertical force on the front wheels can be
expressed as follows:
Fz = M
2L(glr −˙vxh)
where L is the distance between the front and rear axles, lr is
the distance from the rear axle to the vehicle Gravity Center
(GC) and h is the height of CG.
The adhesion coefﬁcient can be deﬁned as a nonlinear
function of the slip ratio between the two contact surfaces.

By deﬁnition, slip ratio is the normalized difference between
the wheel speed and vehicle speed
λ = vω −vx
vω
,
where
vω = Rωw
Several formulations have been developed in the literature
to aproximate the longitudinal adhesion coefﬁcient (Pacejka,
Kienke, Dugoff, etc.). Most of them are functions of the slip
ratio using nonlinear relationships, however these models are
hardly usable for model based control, since they leeds to
very complex models. The adhesion coefﬁcient is assumed
in some research works to be proportional to the slip ratio
[14], but this assumption leads to a linear model which
is only valid for small values of the slip ratio. Hence,
for large slip ratio, a nonlinear model must be considered.
To overcome this problem, we propose to approximate the
nonlinear behavior of the adhesion coefﬁcient by a fuzzy TS
model with two rules which describes all of the operating
regions.
D. TS model description
In order to simplify the controller design, nonlinear model
(11) is approximated in this paper by a TS fuzzy model.
In the ﬁrst step, the nonlinearity of the adhesion coefﬁcient
µ(λ) can be considered using the following rule based
system:
I f
λ
is
M1
then
µ(λ) = Cλ1λ
I f
λ
is
M2
then
µ(λ) = Cλ2λ
(12)
where Cλi depend on the considered road conditions. M1(M2)
is a fuzzy set for small (large) slip angles, which fuzzy
meaning is given by hλ1(hλ2).
Using the above described fuzzy rules, the Adhesion
coefﬁcient µ(λ) is written as follows:
µ(λ) = hλ1Cλ1λ +hλ2Cλ2λ
(13)
Where membership functions hλi, (i = 1,2) satisfy the fol-
lowing properties:






∑
i=1
hλi(λ) = 1

and are given by the following expressions:
hλi(λ) =
fi(λ)

(15)
where

(16)
Parameters of membership functions (ai, bi and ci)
are obtained using an identiﬁcation method based on the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combined with the least
square method [15].
Using the TS model of the adhesion coefﬁcient given in
(13), vehicle model (11) can be represented by the following
TS fuzzy model:

Let us now consider the other nonlinearity of model (17)
given by z = Fz/vω such that:
zmin < z < zmax
where
zmax = Fzmax
vωmin
,
zmin = Fzmin
vωmax
Variable z can be written in the following form:
z = hz1zmax +hz2zmin
(18)
with
hz1 =
z−zmin
zmax −zmin
,
hz2 =

Substituting (18) into (17) the TS fuzzy model is obtained
in the following form

III. CONTROL STRATEGY
The main goal of the control strategy is to provide the
tracking of a reference value given by the desired slip ratio.
The engine torque is considered as control inputs when the
slip ratio exceeds a ﬁxed threshold value (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3.
Global structure of the controller
The idea is to force the wheel speed to track a desired
value vωd which depends on the desired slip ratio λd and the
vehicle speed:
vωd =
vx
1−λd
The measurement of the vehicle speed and the wheel speed
are necessary for the controller design and the membership
function computation. The structure of the proposed fuzzy
controller is given as follows
u(t) = −

Let us denote the tracking error dynamic:
˙ec = vω −vωd
Substituting (21) into (19) the following augmented system
is obtained:

where O is the zero matrix of appropriate dimensions
In order to simplify the stability conditions of the closed
loop system, augmented system (22) can be rewritten as
follows
˙¯x(t) =
4
∑
i=1
hi


w(t) = vωd(t)
In order to stabilize closed-loop system (23), H∞and
Lyapunov approaches will be used to compute the controller
gains.
Let us consider the H∞performance related to the tracking
error ec with null initial conditions as follows
Z ∞
0 ec(t)Tec(t)dt ≤ρ2
Z ∞
0 w(t)Tw(t)dt
This H∞performance criterion can be rewritten in the fol-
lowing form:
Z ∞
0
¯xT(t)CT
e Ce ¯x(t)dt ≤ρ2
Z ∞
0 w(t)Tw(t)dt
(24)
with Ce = [0 0 1].
The objective is to design fuzzy controller (21) such that
closed-loop system (23) satisﬁes the following speciﬁcations:
1) Augmented system (23) is globally stable with the
controller (21).
2) H∞performance (24) for augmented system (23) is
satisﬁed.
The following lemma presents the stabilization conditions of
fuzzy system (23) under H∞performance (24).
Lemma 1: [16] If there exist a symmetric positive deﬁnite
matrix P, a positive scalar ρ, solutions of the following
inequalities:
P( ¯Ai −¯BiKi)+( ¯Ai −¯BiKi)TP+ 1
ρ2 P ¯Bw ¯BT
wP+CT
e Ce < 0
i = 1,4
(25)
then fuzzy closed loop system (23) is globaly asymptotically
stable and the H∞control performance in (24) is guaranteed
for a prescribed attenuation level ρ2.
Corollary 1: If there exist a common symmetric positive
deﬁnite matrix X, matrices Vi, Ki and scalars ρ > 0, solution
of the following inequalities:

i = 1,4
(26)
where I is the identity matrix of appropriate dimensions
Γi = ¯AiX +X ¯AT
i −¯BVi −V T
i ¯BT
Vi = KiX
Then fuzzy closed loop system (23) is asymptotically stable
and the H∞control performance in (24) is guaranteed for a
prescribed attenuation level ρ2.
Proof 1: Pre- and post-multiply by X where X = P−1 and
using matrices Vi = KiX inequality (25) can be expressed in
the following form:
Ωi = ¯AiX −¯BiVi +X ¯AT
i −V T
i ¯BT
i + 1
ρ2 ¯Bw ¯BT
w +XCT
e CeX < 0
Using Schur’s complement, LMI conditions (26) are ob-
tained.

Parameters X and Vi (thus Ki = ViX−1) can be easily
obtained by solving (26).
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed
controller, two tests have been conducted in Matlab/Simulink
using nonlinear model (11) on a slippery road. Vehicle
parameters are given in table (I).

In the ﬁrst test the input depicted in Fig. 4 has been used as
the desired engine torque given by the driver. In the second
test, the engine torque has been computed by the controller
so that the longitudinal slip ratio does not exceed desired
value λd = 0.2.
Simulation results in Fig. 4 show the vehicle response in
the ﬁrst test; the wheel speed has increased up to 45m/s
while the vehicle speed has not exceeded 22m/s. This implies
that the wheel has slipped during this test. The ﬁgure also
shows the longitudinal slip ratio in this test which exceeds
0.2 at 4s. We can conclude that in this test the vehicle has lost
its stability and the traction has not been at the optimal level.
In the second test, the vehicle is equipped with the traction
control which computes the optimal value of the engine
torque. Simulation results of this test are depicted in Fig. 5.
In this test, the wheel speed and the vehicle speed has been
increased so that the slip ratio still stays at its desired value.
This implies that the vehicle has accomplished the test with
the maximum stability and optimal traction performance.
In order to show the advantage of the traction control in
optimizing energy consumption, the fuel consumption rate
has been computed in this simulation in grams per second
(g/s) as follows [17]:
r f = SfcP
(27)
where P is the produced power in watt whith P = Teωe and
Sfc is a constant of the speciﬁc fuel consumption which
depends on the engine and fuel speciﬁcation. The quantity
of the fuel consumption is given in grams and deduced from
(27) as follows:
qf =
Z t
0 SfcP(t)dt
(28)
Figure 6 shows that the control traction system can also be a
good way to save energy consumption in slipping situations.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have developed a robust control method
for the traction control systems. The objective of the control
system is to compute the optimal engine torque in order to
improve the vehicle traction and to avoid wheel slipping
in critical situations such slippery roads. To achieve this

been based on the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy representation
of the the vehicle longitudinal dynamics, the drivetrain model
and the wheel motion. The proposed constraints can globally
asymptotically stabilize the closed loop TS fuzzy system with
the minimization of an H∞performance criterion in order to
satisfy the tracking performances for any desired value of the
slip ratio. Simulation results have veriﬁed and conﬁrmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach to ensure the vehicle
