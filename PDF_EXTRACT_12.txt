Abstract: This paper describes a strategy for warning and intervention to assist the driver in a lane change 
manoeuvre. The proposed strategy consists of a relative motion estimator and supervisor. In order to assess 
threat in a lane change situation, vehicle sensor information and rear-side radar sensor information have 
been combined in the relative motion estimator. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to estimate and revise 
information of relative motion between the subject vehicle and threat vehicle in the adjacent lane. The 
supervisor is designed to determine criterions of warning and intervention by the lateral driver support 
system and desired dynamics to prevent a collision in a lane change situation. In order to determine 
appropriate criterions with a consideration of threat level, the kinematics of the vehicles in longitudinal and 
lateral direction have been analyzed. The results of this research could be used to assess safety and threat 
in a lane change situation. Furthermore it could be applied to provide warnings or intervention for the lane 
change assistance system.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, the interest in the safety and comfort of 
passengers has been growing. According to previous research 
by NHTSA (2007), traffic accidents during a lane change 
manoeuvre account for about 12percent of all traffic 
accidents in USA. Also according to another research, the 
reason of 13percent of all traffic accidents on German 
freeways in 2009 is a collision by lateral moving vehicles in 
the same direction (Habenicht et al. 2011). During these 
types of collisions, most drivers do not attempt to avoid a 
collision due to unawareness of a crash danger (Tiderman et 
al. 2007).  Moreover the driver faces a high level of stress by 
many tasks which should be carried out in parallel during a 
lane change manoeuvre. For instance, the driver has to 
manoeuvre the throttle pedal, brake pedal and steering wheel 
and monitor for vehicles in the adjacent lanes at the same 
time. Therefore it can be concluded that lateral driver support 
systems have the potential to decrease the number of traffic 
accidents in a lane change situation.   
In order to reduce these types of accidents, there are many 
ongoing studies on lane change assistance (LCA) system. 
Ruder et al. (2002) designed a lane change assistant system to 
help the driver avoiding critical situation during lane changes. 
Ruder et al. assumed that the vehicles involved in lane 
change manoeuvre to keep constant velocity. Bascunana et al. 
(1997) determined the conditions for two vehicles involved in 
lane change manoeuvre for safe lane changing. Jula et al. 
(2000) presented a general algorithm to determine the 
minimum longitudinal safety spacing (MSS) that all vehicles 
involved in lane change manoeuvre should initially have so 
that no collision occurs. In order to determine the condition 
for safe lane changing, Bascunana et al. (1997) and Jula et al. 
(2000) analysed the kinematics of the vehicles in a lane 
changing scenario and all vehicles except for the subject 
vehicle are assumed to keep constant velocity during the 
manoeuvre. Sepulcre et al. (2011) used the constant 
acceleration model to obtain the MSS. In these researches 
mentioned above, the relative motion in the longitudinal 
direction has been simply considered to obtain a safe region 
in the initial longitudinal spacing and relative longitudinal 
velocity plane. However the risk of the collision during a lane 
change manoeuvre is related to not only the relative motion 
in the longitudinal direction but also the relative motion in 
the lateral direction.  
This paper focuses on the design of a strategy for warning 
and intervention to assist the driver to change the lane. In 
order to consider relative longitudinal and lateral motion

between the subject vehicle and the vehicle in the adjacent 
lane, vehicle sensor information and rear-side radar sensor 
information have been combined. Moreover, the kinematics 
of the vehicles has been analysed to determine criterions of 
warning and intervention for lane change assist system. Then 
the desired dynamics to avoid a collision during a lane 
change manoeuvre are determined.  
The rest of this paper is organized in the following manner: 
Section 2 presents the overall architecture of the proposed 
strategy for LCA. The design of the relative motion estimator 
is described in Section 3 and the supervisor is described in 
Section 4. The contribution of this research and introduction 
of future works are summarized in Section 5.  
2. ARCHITECTURE 
 The overall architecture of the proposed strategy for LCA is 
organized as shown in Fig. 1. The proposed strategy consists 
of a relative motion estimator and supervisor. An Extended 
Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate and revise 
information of relative motion between the subject vehicle 
and threat vehicle in the adjacent lane. The supervisor is 
designed to assess safety and determine a desired dynamics 
in a lane change situation. Based on the analysis of the 
kinematics of the vehicle in longitudinal and lateral direction, 
the condition of activation of LCA is determined and the 
current safety is assessed in the supervisor. Then the desired 
longitudinal and lateral acceleration are determined to 
prevent a collision between the subject vehicle and 
approaching vehicle in the adjacent lanes.

3. DESIGN OF RELATIVE MOTION ESTIMATOR 
 Since the information of relative motion between the subject 
vehicle and approaching vehicle in the adjacent lanes is 
needed to assess safety or risk during a lane change 
manoeuvre, the relative motion estimator has been designed 
as shown in Fig. 2. The commercial sensors including sonar, 
vision and radar provide quite precise relative measurements 
such as relative longitudinal position and velocity. However, 
the performance of relative measurements such as relative 
lateral position and velocity is not enough to design a driver 
support system using only these environment sensors (Kim et 
al. 2012a). Detailed and precise information about the vehicle 
surroundings is required to active safety technology. In order 
to obtain more precise information about the vehicle 
surroundings, vehicle sensor information and rear-side radar 
sensor information have been combined as mentioned above.

 is the yaw angle

 is the yaw rate of the subject

measurement vector contains the information such as relative 
positions, relative velocities. Furthermore the information 
about yaw rate, longitudinal velocity and acceleration of the 
subject vehicle are included in measurement vector. After the 
discretization of this continuous system, EKF has been 
applied to obtain more accurate information about the relative 
motion between the subject vehicle and approaching vehicle 
in the adjacent lanes (Caveney et al. 2004, Eidehall et al. 
2005).  
In order to evaluate this relative motion estimator, the 
vehicle tests were conducted on a test track. The rear-side 
radar sensors were implemented on the subject vehicle. For 
the evaluation of the accuracy of the estimated relative 
motion, GPS was implemented on the vehicles to measure 
accurate relative positions and velocities. The blue solid lines 
and black dashed lines in Fig. 3 indicate the measurements of 
GPS and rear-side radar respectively. The red dashed lines in 
Fig. 3 indicate the estimated signals by the proposed relative 
motion estimator. Comparisons of the relative longitudinal 
distance and velocity are shown in Fig. 3-(a) and (c). It can 
be known that the rear-side radar provides accurate 
information on the relative longitudinal distance and velocity. 
Fig. 3-(b) and (d) show relative position and velocity in the 
lateral direction. As shown in Fig. 3-(d), the relative lateral 
velocity information should be estimated and revised since 
the measurement of the rear-side radar is imprecise on some 
occasions. It can be seen that the estimated information of 
relative lateral velocity is similar to the measurement of GPS. 
Therefore it can be concluded that the estimated information

4. DESIGN OF SUPERVISOR FOR LCA 
In order to assess safety and determine criterions of warning 
and intervention for lane change assist system, the kinematics 
of the vehicles has been analysed. In a lane change situation, 
the probability of the collision with the approaching vehicle 
in the adjacent lane is higher than that with the preceding 
vehicles running ahead of subject vehicle in current lane or 
adjacent lanes (Tim et al. 2005). Therefore this research 
focuses on the analysis of the kinematics of the subject 
vehicle and approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane. The 
scenario depicted in Fig. 4 is used in this research.  
According to previous research by Mar et al. (2005), about 
80% of drivers manoeuvre the throttle pedal or brake pedal in 
the process of lane change. Based on this result, we assume 
that the subject vehicle changes lanes with constant 
acceleration. Moreover, when the approaching vehicle in the 
adjacent lane is entering into the lane of the subject vehicle, 
drivers generally tend to apply zero-throttle or brake (Moon 
et al. 2010). Based on this result, the profile of relative 
longitudinal acceleration of approaching vehicle in the 
adjacent lane is assumed as shown in Fig. 5. It is assumed 
that the subject vehicle starts the lane change manoeuvre at t 
= 0. The time constant 
reaction
t
 denotes the time-instant at 
which the driver of approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane 
starts to decelerate. In this research, the approaching vehicle 
in the adjacent lane is assumed to apply relative deceleration 
when the subject vehicle starts to cross lanes. Therefore the 
time constant reaction
t
 is assumed to be same as time to lane 
crossing which can be known from the vision sensor 
information. The time constant 
ch
t
 denotes the time-instant 
that the subject vehicle completes the lane change.

The relative motion between the subject vehicle and 
approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane for the kinematics 
analysis can be depicted as shown in Fig. 6. In order to 
ensure safety after the lane change manoeuvre, the MSS to 
avoid rear-end collision accidents between the subject vehicle 
and approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane is determined in 
this section.

Fig. 6. Description of relative motion during a lane change 
manoeuvre 
 For the determination of the appropriate longitudinal safety 
spacing in various driving situation, the relative motion in the 
lateral direction should be considered as mentioned above. 
Jula et al. (2000) used a realistic model for the lateral 
acceleration during a lane change manoeuvre designed as a 
sine function of time and assumed the total elapsed time for a 
lane change manoeuvre. However the driving characteristics 
in a lane change situation varies with age, sex, driving 
experience and driving situations. For instance, in severe lane 
change situation, there could be some differences between 
that assumption and current manoeuvres. In this research, the 
required time to complete the lane change 
ch
t
 is calculated 
with consideration of current driving situation as follows:

In order to determine an activation condition of warning for 
LCA, the longitudinal clearance in the time interval [0, ch
t ]  
is calculated on the assumption that the relative longitudinal 
acceleration in the current state is maintained during a lane 
change manoeuvre.

 The intervention for LCA should be provided on the 
condition that the approaching vehicle could not avoid a 
collision using an admissible relative deceleration. For the 
determination of an appropriate intervention condition, the 
longitudinal clearance in the time interval [0, ch
t ] is calculated 
on the assumption that the driver of approaching vehicle 
applies relative deceleration after reaction
t
when he recognizes 
the lane change of subject vehicle.

intervention. In this simulation, the initial speed of subject 
vehicle

x rel ini
a
 of 0, the time gap of 0.3, and relative decelerations 
,
,
x rel brake
a
 of -2.5m/s2 are used. In order to obtain a safety 
clearance minimizing frequent warning or intervention, the 
maximum relative decelerations is chosen as -8m/s2. As 
shown in Fig. 7, the MSSs for LCA decrease as the lateral 
distance decreases. It means that the activation of proposed 
LCA strategy is dependent on the required time to complete 
the lane change. Fig. 8 shows that the warning and 
intervention of LCA should be provided rapidly as the 
relative longitudinal velocity between the subject vehicle and 
approaching vehicle increases. Meanwhile the difference 
between MSS for warning and MSS for intervention 
decreases as the relative lateral velocity increases. It’s 
because ch
t  decreases as the relative lateral velocity increases 
and the effect of relative deceleration, 
,
,
x rel brake
a
, decreases. 
Therefore it can be confirmed that the warning and 
intervention should be activated at almost the same time as 
the relative lateral velocity increases.

4.2 Desired Dynamics 
When the collision between the subject vehicle and 
approaching vehicle is expected during a lane change 
manoeuvre, the subject vehicle should be controlled to avoid 
a collision. Eidehall et al. (2005) presented that the required 
strength of overlay steering torque for emergency lane assist 
system increases as the time to collision (TTC) decreases. 
Szabo et al. (2004) presented a desired lateral acceleration to 
prevent a road departure which is only dependent on lateral 
velocity and lateral distance.  
The supervisor proposed in this paper is designed to 
determine not only the desired relative longitudinal 
acceleration but also the desired relative lateral acceleration 
for collision avoidance in a lane change situation. First the 
desired relative longitudinal acceleration is defined as 
follows:

where, k1 and k2 mean the control gains and these are chosen 
as 0.3 and 0.1 respectively in this research. Fig. 9 shows that 
the required relative longitudinal acceleration for LCA 
increases as the longitudinal clearance in the current state 
decreases. 
Meanwhile, in order to prevent a collision in lateral 
direction, the relative lateral distance at TTC should satisfy 
the below condition.

where, wv is the width of vehicle and ws is the safety distance 
to guarantee no collision. The widths of all the vehicles are 
assumed to be same and chosen as 1.9m in this analysis. 
Furthermore the safety distance ws is chosen as 0.3m in this 
analysis. Based on this assumption, the minimum value of 
require lateral acceleration to prevent a collision between the 
subject vehicle and approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane 
can be calculated as follows:

As shown in Fig. 10, the absolute value of required relative 
lateral acceleration for LCA increases as TTC decreases and 
the relative lateral velocity increases. It means that the large 
lateral acceleration is required to avoid a collision as the 
collision probability in the longitudinal direction increases.

5. CONCLUSION 
 A strategy for warning and intervention to assist the driver 
during a lane change manoeuvre has been proposed. The 
proposed strategy is composed of two parts: a relative motion 
estimator and supervisor. The vehicle sensor information and 
rear-side radar sensor information have been combined and 
then relative motion is estimated using EKF. Based on the 
kinematics analysis, the supervisor is designed to activate 
warning and intervention for LCA and determine desired 
dynamics. The results of this research could be used to assess 
threat and provide warning or intervention during a lane 
change or lane departure situation. In the future, the vision 
sensor information should be integrated to obtain more 
precise information about the vehicle surroundings and all the 
vehicles around the subject vehicle should be considered in 
determining the desired dynamics for LCA. Furthermore the 
control algorithm which distributes actuator’s control inputs 
to obtain the desired dynamics should be designed in the 
future.
