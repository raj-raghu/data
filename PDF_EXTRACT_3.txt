1. Introduction 
In recent years, the comprehensive optimization and advancement of intelligent transportation 
systems have increasingly highlighted the role of artificial intelligence in vehicular safety. Traffic 
signs, with their conspicuous, standardized, and clear text, graphics, and symbols within a certain 
range, have consistently been the primary focus of image recognition technology in the field of traffic. 
Since the inception of image recognition technology, traffic sign recognition algorithms and models 
have garnered widespread attention [1]. This technology has matured significantly, finding 
applications in autonomous driving. Despite the existence of numerous recognition methods, the 
challenge of detecting and recognizing traffic signs with higher accuracy and speed remains a primary 
concern in current research [2]. The evolution of machine vision and strides in image processing 
technology have enhanced the significance of traffic sign recognition in transportation, offering 
substantial practical value for the advancement of intelligent transportation. 
Traffic sign detection and recognition typically involve segmentation positioning and recognition 
classification. Generally, traffic signs are extracted from natural scenes by utilizing their shape and 
color features. The recognition classification aims to identify the content of the detected traffic signs. 
Presently, deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks demonstrate high accuracy 
and robust anti-interference capabilities in traffic sign recognition applications. They represent a key 
breakthrough in overcoming the reliability issues of automatic traffic sign recognition [3]. Recent 
developments in machine learning have significantly transformed image recognition. By setting 
simple judgment conditions and enriching the feature library with learning samples in various forms 
and scenes, the system progressively enhances its cognition and recognition probability of traffic 
signs. Machine learning enables recognition to transcend reliance on specific fixed parameters, 

 
509 
allowing the system to identify targets through a series of conditional judgments, thereby elevating 
the accuracy and flexibility of recognition [4]. This burgeoning field has become a focal point of 
research, significantly refining image recognition accuracy. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews 
traffic sign recognition technology based on deep learning, outlining several key steps in the 
recognition process. It highlights the advantages of deep learning-based traffic sign recognition over 
other methods, and analyzes the substantial progress made in recent years. This review aims to offer 
fresh perspectives for the development of traffic sign recognition technology and contribute practical 
insights for the construction of intelligent transportation systems. 
2. Relevant Theories 
According to the categories, traffic signs can be divided into warning signs on a yellow background 
with black edges, prohibition signs on a white background with red circles, and indication signs on a 
blue background with white words. The shapes are mainly triangles, circles and rectangles. The clear 
shape color distinction and the limited number of signs provide a relatively stable application 
environment for image recognition [5]. 
As shown in Figure 1. Traffic sign detection and recognition using image recognition technology is 
generally divided into the following working steps:

2.1. Pre-processing procedures 
Preprocessing methods include histogram equalization, white balance, brightness adjustment and so 
on. In the actual traffic scene, due to the influence of various factors such as motion jitter, natural 
light, weather conditions and so on, it is inevitable that a certain degree of interference and noise will 
be introduced into the collected images [6]. Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the collected 
images to eliminate these adverse factors. Through image equalization, image enhancement and 
image denoising algorithms, the light of the image is equalized, so that the image becomes clear and 
easy to identify, so as to highlight the key information. The pre-processing is good for feature 
extraction and classification, which greatly improves the timeliness and accuracy of detection, and 
reduces the complexity of the following problem. Image preprocessing often determines the final 
effect to a certain extent. 
2.2. Traffic Signs Segmentation and Positioning 
The preprocessed image still contains a lot of information, and traffic signs only account for a very 
small part of it. In order to reduce the amount of data processed and speed up the processing speed, 

 
510 
the area of the traffic sign is generally detected and located first, and then the specific meaning of the 
traffic sign in this area is judged [7]. In order to play a warning role, traffic signs have certain 
particularity and easy to distinguish in color and shape, and can be classified to a certain extent 
according to the following figure 2. Therefore, two methods are usually used to detect and locate 
traffic signs: image binarization processing based on color segmentation and ROI extraction based 
on shape detection.

2.3. Traffic sign Classification and Recognition (Feature extraction) 
After the image segmentation and positioning is completed, only the key information of traffic signs 
is left in the image. At this time, it is necessary to further extract and compare these image features 
to identify the specific information [8]. The key features of the image are the key factors to identify 
the specific information, and the quality of the features directly determines the accuracy of 
recognition. Generally speaking, these key features need to have several elements such as 
distinguibility, parsimony and anti-interference to ensure the detection speed and efficiency, while 
ensuring as little as possible to be affected by noise, natural light and image distortion. 
3. Traffic Sign Classification and Recognition Based on Deep Learning 
Deep learning has significantly advanced image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language 
processing domains. Notably, it was first applied to image recognition in 1898 by LeCun and 
colleagues, who successfully utilized a deep neural network with a convolutional structure known as 
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [9]. 
The LeNet-5 network stands as a quintessential model of CNNs. This network initially employs local 
connections and shared weights to extract features from input grayscale images, significantly 
reducing the model's training complexity and markedly enhancing its recognition and classification 
accuracy. Subsequently, the AlexNet and VGGNet networks were introduced, characterized by 
additional convolutional and connection layers, thereby refining the model's classification and 
recognition capabilities. Currently, CNN-based detection models are predominantly categorized into 
single-stage and two-stage models, which encounter challenges with slow detection speeds due to 
their process complexity. In response, GirshickR et al. introduced the R-CNN algorithm based on 
candidate region extraction, followed by RenS et al. who developed the enhanced FasterR-CNN 
algorithm, improving the candidate box generation approach. The introduction of an end-to-end 
convolutional neural network led to the proposal of the YOLO series network [10]. Subsequently, 
more streamlined object detection network models such as SSDLite and YOLO-LITE emerged, along 
with an improved SSD network-based traffic sign detection method. Yin et al. employed the YOLOv5 
network, an evolution of YOLOv3, which demonstrates superior performance in traffic sign 
recognition. The continuous optimization of related algorithms significantly bolsters algorithmic 
performance. Nonetheless, comprehensive enhancement of recognition performance remains a 
challenge, necessitating further advancements.

As shown in Figure 3. Deep learning-based detection algorithms generally fall into two categories: 
one-stage and two-stage. The one-stage method derives output directly from input, while the two-
stage approach first selects a subset of features, i.e., pre-selected boxes, during the input-output 
process. A comparative analysis of these one-stage and two-stage methods is as follows: 
 
Fig. 3 Comparison of the two methods (Photo/Picture credit: Original). 
The biggest difference between convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm and traditional 
machine recognition algorithm is that convolutional neural network can extract features while training, 
which can effectively improve the efficiency of detection and training. This gives convolutional 
neural networks a huge advantage in terms of detection performance and accuracy, especially for 
traffic sign recognition under complex conditions such as enhanced illumination, weather conditions, 
object occlusion, and shooting angles. 
In recent years, with the unremitting efforts and innovation of researchers in the field of image 
recognition, more and more deep learning models and their variants applied to image recognition 
have been published to the public, and deep learning has been widely used in the field of intelligent 
transportation. 
3.1. Based on the Improved LeNet-5 
The LeNet model was proposed by Yann Lecun, the father of convolutional neural network. It is a 7-
layer neural network. The network model is simple. The algorithm takes a long time and the 
recognition rate is low in complex traffic sign recognition. Zhang Meng et al improved and optimized 
the original LeNet-5 network by constructing sub-convolutional networks. By changing the size of 
convolution kernels, increasing the number of convolution kernels, adding nonlinear activation 
function ReLU and Dropout layer to improve feature extraction, reduce overfitting, and to make the 
network more stable. The accuracy of the improved network for traffic sign recognition reaches 
93.558%. This recognition method of multi-convolution kernel and multi-scale features can achieve 
high accuracy in a short time, and has good robustness and generalization. Li Da et aleffectively 
preprocessed and augmented the data set, added convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully 
connected layer to the model to increase the depth of the model, and used ReLU activation function 
instead of Sigmoid activation function to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The 
average accuracy of the improved LeNet-5 network in the validation data set reaches 99.42%, which 
is 4.93% higher than that of the traditional model. Wang Guiping et al introduced the Inception 
convolution module group on the basis of the traditional network to extract the rich features of the 
target. At the same time, he not only increased the depth of the network and introduced the BN layer 
to normalize the input batch samples, but also changed to Relu activation function with better 
performance. 
3.2. Based on the improved residual network 
ResNet was proposed by Dr. He from Microsoft Research. Compared with the VGG-Net network, 
the residual network can not only obtain deeper network layers without affecting the gradient stability, 

 
512 
but also better control the number of model parameters. Building a target classification model based 
on CNN convolutional neural network will cause a series of problems such as model gradient 
explosion and disappearance with the deepening of the network. The emergence of ResNet can solve 
this problem well. How to ensure the accuracy of traffic sign recognition while still well controlling 
the iteration time and calculation amount of model training is a technical difficulty for researchers to 
overcome. Huang Shangan constructed an "eight-block ResNet model" according to the 
characteristics of traffic signs itself, and combined the log-likelihood cost function. It can solve the 
problem of gradient explosion and disappearance, not only control the model training iteration speed, 
but also improve the recognition accuracy. The improved model is tested on the public data set 
GTSRB of traffic sign recognition, and the test accuracy reaches 99.74%.In view of the continuous 
loss of high-level information of the image in the downsampling process of the traditional residual 
network model, which leads to insufficient feature extraction, Liang Zhengyou et al improved the 
ResNet network structure and proposed a traffic sign recognition method based on multi-scale 
features and attention mechanism, which fused the multi-scale features of each level of the model. 
Through the attention mechanism to strengthen the characteristics of different channels, the accuracy 
of the improved model on the GTSRB and BelgiumTS traffic sign datasets reaches 99.31% and 98.96% 
respectively, which is better than the state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition algorithms. The 
recognition accuracy of the improved ResNet model is significantly improved, which can better meet 
the high accuracy requirements of traffic sign recognition tasks. Although the proposed method 
effectively improves the accuracy of automatic traffic sign recognition, it increases the complexity 
and calculation of the model. Therefore, how to reduce the complexity of the model, reduce the time 
and computing resources required by the algorithm, and better meet the real-time applications and 
requirements under the premise of ensuring the recognition accuracy will be their next research 
direction. As shown in Figure 4. 
 
Fig. 4 Model structure (Photo/Picture credit: Original). 
3.3. Based on YOLO-v5 
YOLO algorithm has attracted much attention in the field of traffic sign recognition because of its 
good recognition performance. Among them, YOLO-V5 has the best recognition speed and 
recognition accuracy in the YOLO series. It is more suitable for practical engineering applications. 
Aiming at the problems of low accuracy and large volume in the traditional model, Zhang Yu et al 
proposed a lightweight algorithm for traffic sign detection based on the YOLO-v5s basic model. They 
used the attention mechanism SENet to improve the C3 module, integrated the CBAM module into 
the model, and cut half of the convolution kernel to realize the lightweight model. TensorRT 
technology is used to deploy the model on Jetson nano. The accuracy of the improved model is 

 
513 
improved to 92.9%, and the FPS reaches 24.1f/s, which meets the requirements of real-time traffic 
sign detection. Zheng Hongbing et al proposed to introduce the GAM into the YOLO-v5 model. And 
replaced the GIoU loss function used in the YOLOv5 algorithm with the CIoU loss function with 
more regression characteristics to optimize the model. The improved algorithm is trained on the 
Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset. The mean average accuracy of traffic sign recognition reaches 
93.00%, which is 5.72% higher than that of the original algorithm, and has better recognition 
performance. 
4. Challenges 
Many traffic accidents are attributed to obstacles in traffic sign recognition, leading to incorrect 
assessments of road conditions. The primary challenges faced by traffic sign detection can be broadly 
categorized into three aspects: 
Traffic signs are constantly exposed to the elements throughout the year. They must withstand various 
complex weather conditions, which can result in color fading, and are also subject to obstructions and 
tilting. 
Traffic signs exhibit a diverse range of colors, and a single image may capture multiple traffic signs, 
adding to the complexity of recognition. 
Due to high speeds and other factors, the captured traffic signs can appear deformed, blurred, or 
distorted, complicating real-time detection and recognition. 
Given the significance of traffic sign detection in reducing traffic accidents, it is a vital concern for 
both the country and society. Despite the formidable challenges, developing a traffic sign detection 
system with high real-time performance and accuracy remains a key focus for many researchers. 
5. Conclusion 
Traffic sign detection and recognition technology is an essential component of intelligent 
transportation systems and presents extensive prospects for development. An increasing number of 
scholars are focusing their research on this area. Currently, many traffic sign detection algorithms, 
particularly those based on deep learning, have shown impressive results in various datasets. As per 
the ongoing developmental trends, future traffic sign detection is expected to integrate multiple 
methodologies, leveraging the strengths of each to enhance overall performance. Advancements in 
traffic sign detection and recognition are pivotal in driving the progress of autonomous vehicle 
technology, thereby advancing human scientific and technological achievements for the greater good.
