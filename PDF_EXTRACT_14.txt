ABSTRACT
This paper describes a lane-keeping support system that
has been developed and implemented in a production
model. This system uses a CCD camera unit to
recognize white lane markers on the road ahead and to
calculate the host vehicle’s lateral displacement from the
center of its lane. An electronic control unit calculates the
amount of steering torque needed to keep the vehicle in
the center and sends a signal to a steering actuator that
steers the front wheels. The electronic control unit has
been designed on the basis of analyses of vehicle
behavior and drivers’ steering behavior. A general outline
of the system is presented along with the results of
driving simulations and actual driving tests. The results
of evaluations conducted on a proving ground course
and with a driving simulator have confirmed that this
system is effective in reducing the driver’s workload.
INTRODUCTION
Vehicle control systems for reducing the driver’s
workload by assisting with the execution of driving
operations 
have 
been 
actively 
researched 
and
commercialized in recent years. For example, many
automobile manufacturers have commercialized an
adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, which uses a
radar-based sensor to detect a vehicle ahead and
controls the throttle and brakes accordingly to maintain a
certain set headway distance. Against this backdrop, we
have developed a lane-keeping support (LKS) system
with the aim of reducing the driver’s workload further on
expressways by helping him/her to execute steering
maneuvers. This system uses a CCD camera to
recognize white lane markers on the road. Based on the
recognition result, an actuator mounted on the steering
shaft generates torque to keep the host vehicle
approximately in the center of its lane. In this way, the
LKS system assists the driver’s steering actions for
keeping the vehicle in its lane. However, while the
provision of an ACC system or an LKS system can
greatly reduce the driver’s workload, there is also
concern about the possibility for various undesirable
effects. These include a delay by the driver in executing
necessary driving actions, the possibility that the assist
force might interfere with the driver’s steering action and
a possible decline in the level of driver alertness. To
resolve 
these 
fundamental 
issues, 
the 
control
parameters of the LKS system have been designed on
the basis of analyses of the relationship between
steering control performance and the driver’s operation
of the vehicle.
This paper describes the design concept and the
effectiveness of the system along with presenting the
results of simulations and driving tests.
FEATURES OF LKS SYSTEM
The LKS system generates torque to assist the driver’s
steering 
action 
for 
keeping 
the 
host 
vehicle
approximately in the center of its lane when traveling
straight ahead on an expressway. This system has the
fundamental capacity to be used on virtually all sections
of Japan’s nationwide expressway network. However,
since it does not ensure absolute reliability for
autonomous driving, its use is limited to providing lane-
keeping support only when traveling straight ahead.The
maximum torque generated by the system is set at a
level that any driver can easily override to steer the
vehicle manually. Moreover, the torque generated by the
system is controlled so that it does not interfere with the
driver’s steering action. This is accomplished by
estimating the driver’s steering action and reducing the
assist force based on the signal from a steering wheel
angle sensor and the output current characteristic or the
signal from a turn signal switch.
The configuration of the LKS system is shown in Fig. 1.
Its major components include a CCD camera unit that
functions to detect white lane markers and to calculate
the forward position the host vehicle is estimated to
reach; a control unit that calculates the torque (current)
for 
assisting 
the 
driver 
in 
keeping 
the 
vehicle
approximately in the center of its lane, based on the
vehicle’s estimated forward position, the steering angle
velocity computed from the output of the steering wheel
angle sensor, and the host vehicle’s speed; a steering
actuator mounted on the steering shaft for generating the
assist force; and a buzzer and a display for indicating to
the driver whether the system is operating or not. The

A brief explanation is given here of the key elements of
the system, including white lane marker recognition, LKS
control and the steering actuator.
OVERVIEW OF LANE MARKER RECOGNITION—The
operations involved in lane marker recognition are shown
in Fig. 2. Image data captured with the monochrome
CCD camera are preprocessed to detect the edges of
the lane markers and to calculate the coordinates of line
candidate points (Fig. 3). Based on these candidate
points, an Observer is used to estimate the road
curvature and the host vehicle’s behavior (pitching and
yawing), which results in the generation of a road model.
The host vehicle’s lateral displacement from the center
of the lane is then calculated.1

OVERVIEW OF LKS CONTROL—Lane-keeping support

using an Observer to estimate the vehicle state. The
configuration of the system is shown in Fig. 4.Two values
are input into the control unit, namely, the lateral
displacement at a forward observed point and the
steering wheel angle, control current is outputted into the
steering actuator. The equations of motion used in
designing the control system are expressed as Eqs. (1),
(2) and (3) below. The vehicle model and the steering
system model are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.2

ACTUATOR CONSTRUCTION—Figure 7 shows the
configuration of the steering actuator. A DC motor is
connected to the steering shaft via a speed change gear.
An electromagnetic clutch is provided to avoid any
degradation of steering feel due to motor inertia when
the LKS system is not operating. The use of a torque
sensor is effective in judging steering intervention by the
driver. However, this system has been configured without
a torque sensor because it is fully capable of judging the
driver’s steering intervention on the basis of the steering
angle velocity and output current characteristic.

DESIGN OF CONTROL PARAMETERS
  As the first step in the process of commercializing this
system, an investigation was made of the maximum total
steering wheel force that is equivalent to the steering
shaft torque multiplied by steering wheel radius. (This is
equivalent to the force that the driver must apply to turn
the steering wheel in the opposite direction under a
condition of maximum actuator output.) The maximum
total steering wheel force applied by LKS control was set
at a level which any drivers would be able to override and
turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction. This
force was set based on the results of tests conducted
with many subjects of both genders and all ages from
young to old. On the basis, the maximum actuator output
(LKS force limit) was designed as explained below.
Fout_max: Maximum total steering wheel force
Factr: Actuator output (converted to an equivalent
steering wheel force)
Factr_lmt: Maximum actuator output (LKS force limit)
Fstr_frc: Overall steering system friction
Factr_frc: Actuator friction loss
Fsat: Steering wheel force generated by self-aligning
torque
The actuator output needed to turn the steering wheel is
defined by the following condition
Factr>Fstr_frc + Fsat
 (4)
The condition of a maximum total steering wheel force of
Fout_max N can be maintained by satisfying the
following equation:
Factr + Fstr_frc + Factr_frc – Fsat ≤ Fout_max       (5)
Based on Eqs. (4) and (5), the LKS force generated by
the actuator is controlled as follows:
Fstr_frc+ Fsat    < Factr
       ≤ Fout_max – Fstr_frc – Factr_frc + Fsat              (6)
Using Eq. (6), the LKS force limit of the actuator was
designed as
Constant A + Fsat ≤ Factr_lmt
                                   ≤ Constant B + Fsat                   (7)
In actual operation, the maximum actuator output is
limited by the motor control current and has been
designed as shown in Fig. 8.

An analysis was then made of the relationship between
the maximum cornering acceleration achieved under
LKS control and the driver’s steering response delay.
That was done on the basis of simulations and
evaluations of the system by test subjects. Although this
system is basically designed to assist the driver’s
steering action, a region actually exists where steering
action by the control is dependable. In this case, there is
concern that, if the system were suddenly released, the
host vehicle might depart from its lane due to the driver’s
steering delay. Possible instances when steering control
might be released include cases where the CCD camera
cannot recognize the lane markers and the occurrence

of a system failure. A simulation was run to analyze the
yaw rate and lateral displacement of the host vehicle as
a function of cornering acceleration in a hypothetical
case where the steering assist torque dropped to zero
during cornering. The simulation results are explained
below.

The reaction time of a driver in executing a steering
maneuver is reported to be around 0.75 s, including the
person’s visual reaction time.3 In order to allow an extra
margin, a design value of 1 s was set for this system. A
distance of 1 meter was set for the departure distance
from the center of the lane. As shown in Fig. 9, the
maximum cornering acceleration rate was found by
simulation to be 2 m/s2 when the vehicle departed from
the center of the lane for at least 1 s.
Actual driving tests were then conducted on a proving
ground course using eight male and female subjects,
who were selected at random and had no connection at
all with the development of this system. In these tests,
measurements were made of the yaw rate with the
control system turned off and of the yaw rate when the
subjects steered the test vehicle to keep it in its lane.
The purpose of the tests was not explained to the
subjects in advance. They first drove the test vehicle for
approximately 20 minutes with the control system turned
on and were instructed to keep their hands on their
knees. In the next series of tests, the control system was
suddenly turned off during cornering, and the yaw rate
was measured when the subjects executed a corrective
steering 
maneuver. 
The 
maximum 
cornering
acceleration rate for all the subjects when they kept the
vehicle in its lane without any departure was 2.0 m/s2.
Representative vehicle yaw rates measured in the tests
are shown in Fig. 10. The yaw rate measured with the
control system turned off was 5.5°/s and that measured
when the subjects executed a corrective steering
maneuver was 6.7°/s. The duration of the maximum
lateral displacement was 0.7 s, indicating that the
subjects kept the vehicle in its lane within the lane
departure time set for the simulation.

Fig.10.Vehicle Behavior During Cornering
             with LKS System Off (experimental)
The foregoing results were obtained under a condition
where control was abruptly lost due to a system failure
(i.e., the clutch was intentionally disengaged). Under
normal operation, the control system is gradually turned
off if the CCD camera can no longer detect the white
lane markers. In this case, the yaw rate measured at a
cornering acceleration rate of 2.0 m/s2 was 3.2°/s and
that measured when the subjects executed a corrective
steering maneuver was 4.3°/s, both of which were
smaller than the above-mentioned values.
It has been reported that drivers are capable of handling
a yaw rate of up to 15°/s when vehicle behavior suddenly
changes due to a control system failure and that an
amply smooth cornering acceleration rate is 4.3°/s.7
Judging from these values, it is thought that drivers
should be able to handle cornering acceleration of 2.0
m/s2 with sufficient leeway.
In production vehicle application, however, cornering
acceleration is limited to 0.5 m/s2 because the system
does not have absolute reliability to ensure autonomous
driving. At that rate, the system can support straight-
ahead 
driving 
against 
disturbances 
of 
0.2%
superelevation (based on the maximum superelevation
on the straight segments of expressways and typical
road configuration examples) and a 5 m/s crosswind.
An investigation was then made of control system
behavior in relation to the driver’s steering intervention.
When the driver executes a steering maneuver, the
assist control force must be reduced quickly so that the
steering torque generated by the LKS system does not
interfere with the driver’s steering action. Usually, a
torque sensor is used to detect steering by the driver. A
torque sensor is particularly effective when the LKS
system is applied to an electronically controlled power
steering system because such a device is originally
Downloaded from SAE International by Univ of California Berkeley, Monday, August 06, 2018

included in the steering system. However, when the LKS
system is applied to an ordinary hydraulic power steering
system, the use of a torque sensor is not practical owing
to numerous limitations stemming from the installation
requirements and desired steering performance. An
analysis was made of lane-keeping steering behavior
and other steering maneuvers, including lane changing
and obstacle avoidance, in driving tests conducted on an
expressway using ordinary drivers. A major expressway
in Japan was selected as the road for making this
evaluation. Frequency distributions of the drivers’
steering angle velocity are shown in Fig. 11.

The results indicate that steering maneuvers executed
for purposes other than lane keeping during LKS system
operation can be distinguished on the basis of the
steering angle velocity. From these results, 
we
considered different situations in which the driver’s
steering action produced steering angle velocity. It was
found that the steering angle velocity could not be
detected when the driver held the steering wheel steady
so that it did not turn in relation to the control force
generated by the LKS system. Accordingly, we focused
on the current characteristics during LKS system
operation and when the driver held the steering wheel
steady in relation to the control force. The current
characteristics of these two situations are compared in
Fig. 12. It is seen in the figure that the frequency at which
the current limit was exceeded clearly differed between
LKS system operation and when the driver was holding
the steering wheel steady. This frequency difference
makes it possible to detect the latter state. The threshold
and timing for making this judgment in real-world driving
were determined by tuning the parameters in driving
tests conducted with an actual vehicle. As a result, the
system 
has 
been 
designed 
such 
that 
steering
intervention by the driver can be judged without using a
torque sensor.

The following discussion concerns an investigation of
lane departure warnings. Three conditions were set for
the issuance of a warning.
Condition 1: When the host vehicle’s present position
deviates from the center of the lane by around 1m.
Condition 2: When the forward position estimated for the
host vehicle one second hence deviates from the center
of the lane by around 1m or more.
Condition 3: When the yaw rate estimated at a forward
distance of 30 m differs from the present yaw rate by
more than about 3 °/s.
In the case of the second condition, lane departure is
predicted and a warning is issued taking into account the
steering response of ordinary drivers, which was
mentioned earlier. In the case of the third condition, lane
departure is predicted based on the steering response
limit of the LKS system and a warning is issued. The
actual parameters for issuing lane departure warnings
were determined on the basis of evaluation results
obtained with an actual vehicle.
EFFECTIVENESS—Using 
the 
control 
algorithm
described earlier, the system was further tuned in tests
conducted with an actual vehicle, and Fig. 13 shows the
lane-keeping performance that was obtained as a result.

 It is seen that the amount of steering wheel movement
during lane keeping by the LKS system was nearly the
same as that measured for a test driver with the system
turned off. The LKS system shows a high level of lane-
keeping performance in terms of lateral displacement
from the lane center and weaving, compared with the
test driver’s straight-line steering behavior when the
system was off. (The steering data shown here for the
test driver were measured when the driver consciously
tried to drive in a straight line.)

Tests were also carried out to investigate the effect of
the LKS system on reducing the driver’s workload. In
order to measure the workload reduction effect
quantitatively, 
frequency 
distributions 
of
electromyograms of the upper arm muscles were
compared with and without the LKS system. Tests were
conducted on a proving ground course with two ordinary
test subjects who drove the test vehicle for two hours
with the LKS system on and for two hours with it turned
off. The ACC speed under both conditions was set at
100 km/h. The results are shown in Fig. 14. It is seen
that the electromyogram distributions were reduced to
approximately one-half when the LKS system was on,
indicating that it reduced the subjects’ steering effort.
The effect of the reduced steering workload on the
driver’s alertness level was then evaluated using test
subjects. In order to make the results clearer, the tests
were conducted with two vehicles. One was fitted with
the LKS system and an ACC system so that it could
navigate the proving ground test course with hardly any
steering by the driver, and the other was equipped with
an 
ACC 
system. 
Driving 
tests 
were 
conducted
continuously for a maximum of two hours with each
vehicle, with a 15-minute rest interval between the tests.
Alertness was divided into three levels on the basis of
the driver’s blinking rate, and the evaluation was based
on the respective percentage of each alertness
level.5The results are shown in Fig. 15. The results of
these tests did not show any significant difference in
alertness levels between the vehicle fitted with the LKS
and ACC systems and the vehicle equipped with the
ACC system, although the alertness level tended to drop
in the vehicle that was driven in the second test.

We‘ve expounded the design and the effect of the Lane-
Keeping 
Support 
system.

application, however, the activation of the control is
restricted on the about straight road of expressway by
the radius of curvature calculated by the camera
because the system does not have absolute reliability to
ensure autonomous driving.
CONCLUSION
If the LKS system is to be accepted by customers as a
highly practical system, it will be essential to resolve
certain issues, such as the avoidance of any unnatural
feeling when the driver steers and any response delay, in
addition to providing good lane-keeping performance.
The LKS system we have developed incorporates a
control algorithm that achieves excellent lane-keeping

performance based on the use of a CCD camera to 
recognize lane markers. Moreover, as a result of 
developing and optimizing an algorithm for detecting the 
driver’s steering intervention and optimizing the range of 
control operation, this newly developed LKS system is 
sufficiently capable of being used in Japan’s expressway 
traffic environment. Tests conducted with actual vehicles 
and a driving simulator have confirmed that this LKS 
system is effective in reducing the driver’s workload. 
Vehicle control systems that reduce the driver’s workload 
by assisting in the execution of driving operations show 
one direction for the future evolution of vehicles. 
Research and development work on technologies in this 
field is projected to accelerate in the next few years. The 
synergies resulting from such advances as well as 
innovations in onboard information and communications 
devices 
are 
expected 
to 
expand 
the 
functional 
capabilities of vehicles dramatically.
